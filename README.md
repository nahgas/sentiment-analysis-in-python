# sentiment-analysis-in-python
This is my first attempt to analyze sentiment in a text. It says whether the text has positive sentiment or negative based on the adjectives present in it. 
File 'positive_words.txt' contains list of positive words.
File 'negative_words.txt' contains list of negative words.
'input_file.txt' is the input text file.
